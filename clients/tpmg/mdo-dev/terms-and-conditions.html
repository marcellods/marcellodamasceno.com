			<p><strong>If you think you have a medical or psychiatric emergency, call 911 or go to the nearest hospital.</strong></p>
			<h2>Agreement</h2>
			<p>BY USING THE WEB SITE, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT USE THE WEB SITE.</p>
			<h2>Revisions, changes and updates</h2>
			<p>We may revise the information on this Web site or otherwise change or update the Web site, including these Terms and Conditions, without notice to you.  TPMG may also make improvements and/or changes in products and/or services described on this Web site or add new features at any time without notice.  We encourage you to periodically read these Terms and Conditions to see if there have been any changes to our policies that may affect you.  Your continued use of the Web site will signify your continued agreement to these Terms and Conditions as they may be revised.</p>
			<h2>Links</h2>
			<p>This Web site provides links to other web sites that are owned or controlled by third parties (&quot;Third Party Web sites&quot;).  We provide links to Third Party Web sites as follows.  TPMG provides links to Third Party Web sites to connect you easily to additional sources of health information or third party services that may be of interest to you.  We may not have any business relationship with the party that controls this type of Third Party Web site and a link to such a site is offered only as a convenience to you.</p>
			<p>TPMG also provides links to sites managed by Kaiser Permanente or vendors that we have made arrangements with to offer you services to help you manage your health or to take and fulfill orders when you purchase items or materials from us.  These sites may be co-branded, meaning that they display the TPMG or Kaiser Permanente logo and the logo of the third party vendor but they are owned or controlled by Kaiser Permanente or the third party.</p>
			<p>In each such instance, we will let you know when you are leaving this Web site and linking to a Kaiser Permanente or Third Party Web site.  For example, we may include a notice advising you that you are being sent to a Kaiser Permanente or Third Party Web site on our web page adjacent to a link or on the first page that appears after clicking on a link.  Or we may use an icon that we identify with an appropriate legend to let you know when you are leaving this Web site.</p>
			<p>TPMG is not responsible for the content, security or the privacy practices of Third Party Web sites that are not owned or controlled by TPMG.  Please review the privacy statement and any terms of use of each Third Party Web site you visit.  Unless we specifically advise you otherwise, links to Third Party Web sites do not constitute or imply endorsement by TPMG of those sites, the information they contain or any products or services they describe.  TPMG does not receive payment or other remuneration in exchange for your linking to or using any Third Party Web sites.</p>
